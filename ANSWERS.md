- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    - Class components allow you to keep state and give you access to the React.Component Lifecycle methods while function components do not.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    - componentDidMount: runs after the component is finished rendering the first time.
    - componentDidUpdate: runs after a state propert was updated.
    - componentWillUnmount: runs right before the component is removed from the Virtual DOM. 
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    - It allows you to reuse functions throughout your app with additional funcitonality that isn't provided by the hooks provided by your libraries. 
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    - You want to feel confident that your app will perform as expected before shipping to production.
